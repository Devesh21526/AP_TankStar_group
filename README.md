# AP_TankStar_group
Created a two-player (1 vs 1) game mode where players face off on hilly terrain, taking turns firing bombs at one another. Players get a limited fuel ration per turn and are allowed to position themselves for a better shot. They can gain weapon upgrades by random airdrops, and must shoot at one another until one of their tanks is destroyed
